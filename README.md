# ShortCalc: WordPress plugin for calculator forms

This plugin makes a shortcode available to show a calculator
form. Calculators can be defined in WordPress as a post (custom
posttype) or in a JSON file.

Calculators can also be defined in a custom format which can be
added from a theme (functions.php). The parsing of formula's is
done with HoaMath, but can also be extended with custom formula
parsers
